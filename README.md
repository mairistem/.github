# Customizing your organization's profile
*You can share information about your organization by customizing your organization's profile.*

## About your organization's profile page

You can customize your organization's Overview page to show a README and pinned repositories dedicated to public users or members of the organization.  

Members of your organization who are signed into GitHub, can select a `member` or `public` view of the README and pinned repositories when they visit your organization's profile page. 

The view defaults to `member` if either a members-only README or members-only pinned repositories are present, and `public` otherwise.  

Users who are not members of your organization will be shown a `public` view.  

## Organization profile READMEs

You can share information about how to engage with your organization by creating an organization profile README for both public users and members of the organization. GitHub shows your organization profile README in the "Overview" tab of your organization.  

You can choose what information to include in your organization profile README. Here are some examples of information that may be helpful.  

- An "About" section that describes your organization
- Guidance for getting help in the organization

You can format text and include emoji, images, and GIFs in your organization profile README by using GitHub Flavored Markdown. For more information, see [Getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).
